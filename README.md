# ML Model Blueprints

A collection of minimal, clean, and well-structured blueprints for common machine learning models.  
Each model is implemented in its own standalone file or notebook for quick reference and easy understanding.

## 📌 Models Included (ongoing list)

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🚀 Goal

To help beginners understand how individual ML models work without overwhelming complexity.  
Ideal for quick reference, learning, and lightweight experimentation.

## 📂 Structure

Each model is in its own file or folder with:
- Clean implementation
- Comments explaining key steps
- Sample dataset or usage example
